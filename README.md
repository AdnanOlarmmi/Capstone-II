# Group capstone: set up your Kanban board

## Learning objectives
- Use the Kanban board with filled-in tasks that have categories and time estimations to assign work in groups.

## Description

In this activity, my team prepared a Kanban board with a GitHub project. As this is the very first group project in our Microverse journey.
In order to copy the Kanban board quickly, we used a special script prepared for us.

### Project requirements

- Joined a Zoom call as team-mates. Only one person copied the board on behalf of the entire team but helped during the call.
- We created an empty repository for our group project.
- Followed the steps described in [curriculum-tools-copy-projects](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-tools-copy-projects).
- Opened the GitHub project (Kanban board) in our team repo.
- Made sure that in the card titles we can see: `Student A`, `Student B`, or `Student C`.
- Made sure that each card starts with `[Xpt]` - that number indicates the number of `points` that shows how complex the task is. **1 point = 1 hour of work**.
- Our group includes two people - so, we removed all cards with `Student C` in the title._
- Decided who in the team is `Student A`, or `Student B`.
- Each of the team members assigned themselves to the correct cards. We then decided who will be the assignee for the cards marked as group tasks. All cards on our Kanban board have assignees.
